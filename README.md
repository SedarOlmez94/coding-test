# Technical Test Instructions

## Objective
Create a class called `Maths` that includes standard mathematical operations. Write unit tests for this class as if it is for a production project. Bonus points can be earned by exposing it as an API in a Docker container.

While writing this project we encourage the use of file and folder structure, build tools, package managers or anything else that you prefer for your real production projects. Of course this is a small task, but if you like poetry, tox, make, pylama or whatever else you like using, definitely do show this. (Those aren't preferred, they are just examples of the sort of thing you might do)

This is a git repo, please do commit your code afterwards, and push it to the repo on an appropriately named branch.

## Requirements
1. Create a class named `Maths`

2. Write unit tests for the `Maths` class using your testing framework of choice. Ensure that all methods are thoroughly tested, including edge cases.

3. Bonus: Expose the `Maths` class as an API using a web framework of your choice (e.g., Flask, FastAPI) and containerize the application using Docker.
